# golden-ratio
# In this code, you can find an approximation of the golden ratio to x decimal places using the Fibonacci sequence. I satrted by writing a code to find the n'th term of the Fibonacci sequence (n being the user's input). Using if statements and for loops helped acheive this in a concise manner I had some problems at first as the code began with the sequence starting at 1 [ 1, 1, 2 etc] even though the sequence begins at 0 [0, 1, 1, 2 etc], therefore I changed the value of a to 0 rather than being 1. I then decided for the next step of my project to use this code to calculate the golden ratio. I had to slightly alter my code by getting a different user input and using more mathematical operators. Initially, the code was printing the same amount of times as the value of 'term' but after adding a break in the for loop and if statement, this issue was resolved.
